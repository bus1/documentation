  <indexdiv><title>Overview</title>
    <para>Bus1 is a subsystem to provide object-oriented Inter-Process Communication
    on Linux. It is a lightweight and scalable way for services and operating system
    tasks to share signals, data and resources; while at the same time allowing
    modularization, privilege separation, information hiding and isolation.</para>

    <para>Bus1 uses lightweight handles to represent objects. It supports single-copy
    data transfer, message multicast and gives global-order guarantees.</para>

    <para>Bus1 itself does not maintain any globally shared state, all references to
    objects need to be explicitly handed out to be visible to a peer.</para>
